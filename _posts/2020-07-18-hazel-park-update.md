description: "Hazel Park updates"
---

This past Thursday I was driving down I-75 on the way back from [Micro Center].
I discovered that the bridgescapes in Hazel Park have changed significantly since 
[my last post]. 

 * There's now a sound-isolating wall between the freeway and Hazelcrest Place 
   apartments, near the **Orchard Avenue** bridge.
 * The **Harry Avenue** new pedbridge is open to the public, even as it still 
   has some scaffolding on its outside.
 * The **Bernhard Avenue** old pedbridge has been demolished (and with it, the 
   memorial to Jynx), and work has begun on its replacement.

Unfortunately, we didn't have time to take new photos on Thursday. I plan on 
taking them the next time I'm up in Hazel Park / Ferndale with my bike.

Also, sorry for the lack of updates. I've been busy with things like helping a 
friend clean out his house, job interviews, and lamenting the recent heat wave 
in Detroit. I documented all the bridges along the Lodge south of I-94 this past 
Tuesday, and I'm going to document all the bridges along I-75 between Ferdinand
(the southernmost currently open bridge) and Leland (in Midtown) tomorrow morning. 
I plan on putting together both of those posts by this coming Tuesday.
