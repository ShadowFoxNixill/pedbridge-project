This post is a compilation of all the extant pedestrian bridges across I-75
in Southwest Detroit. Similarly to the [Lower Lodge] post, I didn't necessarily ride 
these bridges in order or on the same day, so I will present them from south 
to north.

The southernmost bridge in the City of Detroit is **Northampton Street**, 
located in the [Boynton-Oakwood Heights] neighbourhood across from the 
[Marathon Petroleum refinery]. According to historical Street View imagery, 
it was closed and barricaded sometime between October 2016 and July 2018. 
When it was open, it connected the refinery with the residential neighbourhood 
to its southeast across Fort Street and I-75.

I've never attempted to ride my bike over this bridge as there's a lot of 
industrial areas and nonexistent bike infrastructure between my apartment and
Boynton that make it unpleasant to get there from here. I know that this bridge 
is closed from driving through the area multiple times this spring.

According to historical Google satellite imagery, there were previously bridges 
across I-75 at **Solvay Street**, **Beard Street**, **Casgrain Street**, and 
**Cavalry Street**. They've all been demolished since 2018 
due to Gordie Howe International Bridge construction, but when they were standing 
Southwest Detroit was *exceptionally* well connected to Delray across I-75. 
Counting both vehicle overpasses and pedbridges, there was a bridge across the 
freeway approximately *every other block* between Springwells Street and West 
Grand Boulevard. 

According to a [January 2020 article] in the *Detroit News*, the design for 
five replacement bridges across I-75 has been selected and construction of them 
is scheduled to begin this year. (As of the writing of this post on 31 July, bridge
construction hasn't started yet.) The new bridges will be built across Solvay Street, 
Beard Street, Waterman Street, Junction Avenue, and Lansing Street. They won't all 
be direct replacements for the demolished bridges, but after they're built 
connectivity across I-75 in Southwest Detroit will be about as good as it was 
pre-2018 except for the stretch dedicated to bridge entrance and exit ramps 
to the freeway.

You'll note that in [Hazel Park], bridges were replaced in a matter of months. 
But in Detroit, bridges were demolished and the design for their replacements 
wasn't even selected until over a year later. [I wonder why].

And as we'll see from the **Ferdinand Street** bridge (which I assume from 
satellite and Street View imagery is pretty much identical to the now-demolished 
bridges), these new bridges will be a much-needed improvement in aesthetics and 
accessibility. This bridge is hideous, inaccessible, and in poor condition.

The next bridge to the north is **Hubbard Street**, which is (naturally)
more aesthetically pleasing and in better repair, considering it abuts the 
[Hubbard Farms] historic district. Can't have the residents of an historically 
affluent area living next to a shitty bridge, amirite?

The last bridge in Southwest Detroit proper lies just outside the Hubbard 
Farms neighbourhood. It's the 
**Bagley Pedestrian Bridge**, which I have visited many times since it's on my 
bike route between home and downtown. I first blogged about it when my friend 
[Nix] and I visited the bridges along the [Southfield Freeway] back in late May, 
but now I'm back with more photos.

 both countries and the aluminium spiral, unity. &para; Aluminium Sculpture,

 * **The Spiral of Life**: This mural is inspired by a resident's comment at a 
 community forum about how life spirals onward, and that challenges take you 
 to a higher place. &para; A hand grasps a ribbon of fabric that flows 
 throughout the artwork and bears the patterning of the community's diverse 
 cultural groups. The resilience of the community and its orientation toward 
 families is celebrated and its culture and history is illustrated by the spires of 
 St. Anne's Church, which is set at a diagonal near the center of the 
 composition, and the Ambassador Bridge and the Detroit River in the upper right.
 &para; The three sisters -- corn, squash, and beans -- and other vegetation 
 refer to urban farming since many people who came to Detroit were farm workers. 
 The migrations to and from Mexico are represented by a suitcase in the lower 
 left. &para; Along the top are images of extended families set amidst a 
 decorative pattern of spirals and the perimeter of the composition displays
